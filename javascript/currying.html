        // Currying is a technique where a function that takes multiple arguments is transformed into a sequence of functions, each taking a single argument.

        // Here's how currying can be beneficial:

        // Partial function application: Currying allows you to create specialized versions of a function by fixing some of its arguments. This can be useful when you want to reuse a function with specific parameters, while keeping some arguments flexible.

        // Code reuse: Currying promotes code reuse by creating higher-order functions that can be composed and combined with other functions. It enables the creation of reusable function factories.

        // Flexibility and composition: Curried functions can be easily composed with other functions to build more complex behavior. By creating functions that take one argument at a time, you gain flexibility in composing them with other functions.


        // To summarize, Currying allows for greater flexibility and composability in your code, enabling you to create specialized functions, reuse code, and build complex behavior by combining smaller functions together.


        //EXAMPLE 1:

        // Simple currying example
        function add(a) {
          return function (b) {
            return a + b;
          };
        }

        const add5 = add(5); 
        console.log(add5(3)); 
        console.log(add5(7)); 







        // Intermediate currying example
        function greet(greeting) {
          return function (name) {
            return greeting + ", " + name + "!";
          };
        }

        const greetHello = greet("Hello"); // Partially applying the greet function with 'greeting' fixed to 'Hello'
        console.log(greetHello("John")); // Output: Hello, John!
        console.log(greetHello("Jane")); // Output: Hello, Jane!







        // Curried mathematical operations
        const add = (a) => (b) => (c) => a + b + c;
        const multiply = (a) => (b) => (c) => a * b * c;

        const addTwoNumbers = add(2);
        console.log(addTwoNumbers(3)(4)); // Output: 9

        const multiplyThreeNumbers = multiply(2)(3);
        console.log(multiplyThreeNumbers(4)); // Output: 24







        // Curried filtering function
        const filter = (predicate) => (array) => array.filter(predicate);

        const isEven = (number) => number % 2 === 0;
        const filterEvenNumbers = filter(isEven);

        const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
        console.log(filterEvenNumbers(numbers)); // Output: [2, 4, 6]






        // Curried function composition
        const compose = (f) => (g) => (x) => f(g(x));

        const increment = (x) => x + 1;
        const double = (x) => x * 2;

        const incrementAndDouble = compose(double)(increment);
        console.log(incrementAndDouble(3)); // Output: 8
